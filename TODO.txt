Store a shared variable that denotes the next train to cross
Initialize a crossing condition variable for each train.
Make a crossing mutex

Create 2 pthreads for prioritizing ready trains.
Producer thread: 
	Writes trains to the ready set after being signalled that a train is done loading
	Re-evaluates which train is next
Consumer thread: 
	Deletes trains from the ready set after being signalled that a train is done crossing
	Re-evaluates which train is next
	Signals the next train to begin crossing
	
Trains' load() function should attempt to lock a crossing mutex
